<h1>Qusaix17 | Data Enthusiast & Physiotherapist 🚀</h1><br>
👋 Hi, I'm Qusai, a physiotherapist who discovered a passion for data analysis. My journey began while working on my graduation project, where I collected and cleaned data from 50+ individuals to answer complex questions. The ability to extract real insights from messy data made me feel like a superhero, motivating me to dive deeper into the world of data!

<h2>🔍 What I Do</h2><br>
I aim to bridge the gap between data and decision-making, leveraging my analytical skills to uncover valuable insights. My goal is to be a strong asset in answering key questions and achieving data-driven success.

<h2>💡 Technical Skills:</h2><br>
✔ SQL, Python, Power BI, Excel (where I have the most fun!)<br>
✔ Data Cleaning, Exploration, and Visualization<br>
✔ Building interactive dashboards to drive insights<br>

<h2>📌 Currently sharpening:</h2><br>
🎯 SQL (Joins, Optimization, Advanced Queries)<br>
🎯 Power BI (Advanced DAX, Data Modeling)

<h2>📂 Projects</h2>
Here are some of my projects:

🧮 [Python Calculator](https://github.com/Qusaix17/Simple-Calculator-python-code.git) (Tkinter) <br>
📜 Changelog App (Python + Tkinter) – Repository Link <br>
🏥 Hospital ER Visits Analysis (SQL, Python, Power BI) – Repository Link <br>
📊 E-commerce Power BI Dashboard – Repository Link <br>
<h4>✨ Proud Moment: My hospital project was my first real-world project where I applied SQL, Python, Excel, and Power BI together!</h4>

<h2>🏋️‍♂️ Personal Interests</h2><br>
Outside of data, I have a strong background in weightlifting and biomechanics. I love experimenting with unconventional workout techniques to optimize performance!
