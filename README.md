qusaix17 | Data Enthusiast & Physiotherapist 🚀
👋 Hi, I'm Qusai, a physiotherapist who discovered a passion for data analysis. My journey began while working on my graduation project, where I collected and cleaned data from 50+ individuals to answer complex questions. The ability to extract real insights from messy data made me feel like a superhero, motivating me to dive deeper into the world of data!

🔍 What I Do
I aim to bridge the gap between data and decision-making, leveraging my analytical skills to uncover valuable insights. My goal is to be a strong asset in answering key questions and achieving data-driven success.

💡 Technical Skills:
✔ SQL, Python, Power BI, Excel (where I have the most fun!)
✔ Data Cleaning, Exploration, and Visualization
✔ Building interactive dashboards to drive insights

📌 Currently sharpening:
🎯 SQL (Joins, Optimization, Advanced Queries)
🎯 Power BI (Advanced DAX, Data Modeling)

📂 Projects
Here are some of my projects:

🧮 Python Calculator (Tkinter) – Repository Link
📜 Changelog App (Python + Tkinter) – Repository Link
🏥 Hospital ER Visits Analysis (SQL, Python, Power BI) – Repository Link
📊 E-commerce Power BI Dashboard – Repository Link
✨ Proud Moment: My hospital project was my first real-world project where I applied SQL, Python, Excel, and Power BI together!

🏋️‍♂️ Personal Interests
Outside of data, I have a strong background in weightlifting and biomechanics. I love experimenting with unconventional workout techniques to optimize performance!
